        <p>
            I have worked as Software Developer in Test for about ten years. Changing stacks and a career
            shift has been a dream of mine for quite some time. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Portland State University. My background in QA and working with the 
            web applications on development test teams should transfer to my new career as a Web Developer.
        </p>

            I also have a certificate in Multimedia Design from Lake Washington Technical College. It was fun creating UX/UI designs and Flash movies.
        </p>

            In my spare time I am a dedicated Dog Mom of two spoiled Shih Tzu Mixes, Noah and Chloe. They are strays and were fostered by Yakima Valley Pet Rescue.  Noah is 11 years old and Chloe is 3 years old.
